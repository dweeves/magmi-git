Magmi GitHub

This is the Official GitHub home for magmi  project (Magento Mass Importer), the original Git is hosted on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/magmi/) but this github repo will be kept in sync.


The [Magmi Wiki](http://wiki.magmi.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is still hosted at sourceforge.

Magento CE 1.8.x  & 1.9.x Support
===================================

Magmi needs you to test it against Magento CE 1.8.x. & Magento CE 1.9.x

It should work for most of it, and maybe it's already working well.

But devil is in the details and i don't have much time doing an extensive test session.

So , if you are using Magento CE 1.8.x or CE 1.9.x , please provide bug reports for any found defects or any incompatibility you might have noticed.

Authentication
==================

Following previous issues with the mis-use of Magmi in an insecure way, Magmi now contains built-in authentication.

Once you have provided DB details and Magmi can connect to the DB, you will need to login using a set of Magento admin credentials to use Magmi. If Magmi has not yet been configured to connect, then the username and password are both 'magmi'

Authentication with PHP-CGI/FPM
-------------------------------

php-cgi/fpm under Apache does not pass HTTP Basic user/pass to PHP by default
     
Add these lines to an .htaccess file:

     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.+)$
     RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
